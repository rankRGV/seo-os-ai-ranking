# SEO OS

## Overview

SEO OS is a Hermes-powered operating system for SEO work. It combines a human-readable Google Sheet, per-client Hermes profiles, VPS workspaces, scheduled jobs, approval workflows, and report/document generation.

Use this skill when helping a user set up, operate, or extend the SEO OS starter kit.

Core mental model:

```text
Google Sheet = operating board
Hermes = worker
Telegram = operator notification layer
Hermes profiles = client separation
VPS file system = internal workspace and data store
Google Docs = polished reports and client-facing deliverables
```

## When to Use

Use this skill when the task involves:

- creating or updating the SEO OS Google Sheet
- adding a new SEO client/site
- creating a per-client Hermes profile or workspace
- planning daily/weekly SEO automation
- approval-gated SEO work
- CTR tests
- review management for local SEO
- client expertise intake
- building a client knowledge library
- generating SEO reports or client updates

Do not use this for generic SEO advice without any SEO OS workflow, Sheet, client profile, or automation context.

## Client Onboarding Sequence

A new Telegram topic plus website URL is only a starting signal. A safe SEO OS setup requires a client registry row, explicit Telegram chat/thread binding, workspace, optional site-specific Hermes profile, GSC/GA4 property mapping, approval policy, and business context.

Recommended sequence:

1. Operator creates a new Telegram topic named after the client and sends the setup message there.
2. Capture client facts with `templates/onboarding/client-intake.md`.
3. Research the public site/client from the website URL, sitemap, homepage, about/service pages, and public search results.
4. Return a short "what I think this client is" brief for the user to correct before locking the profile.
5. Run `scripts/setup_seo_os.py` with client name, domain, offer, audience, conversion goal, GSC/GA4 properties, Telegram target, and first workflow. With a Telegram target, the script should create the per-client profile by default, upsert the dashboard when available, and send a completion message back to the same topic.
6. Verify Telegram routing with outbound and inbound topic tests.
7. Verify read-only GSC/GA4, sitemap, robots.txt, and homepage access.
8. Generate a baseline report and top opportunities.
9. Ask for one bounded first approval, usually low-CTR title/meta planning or one-page SERP gap analysis.
10. Dashboard approval should update state, create or update a bounded task, send Telegram confirmation, and leave production changes separately gated.

See `docs/onboarding-sequence.md` for the full community-ready flow.

## Non-negotiable Client Filtering Rule

Every tab, dashboard section, API query, Sheet updater, and report index must respect the selected client. If the user filters to one client, show only rows where `client_id` exactly matches that client. Do not show another client's CTR tests, jobs, approvals, content items, opportunities, tasks, reports, activity, or performance. Global/all-client policy rows should appear in the All Clients view only unless intentionally copied into that client's own rows.

Before onboarding, search existing clients by domain and common variants. Use the canonical existing `client_id` if found. Do not create duplicate clients because of slug differences like `my-inclusion` vs `myinclusion`.

## Google Sheet Principles

Visible tabs should be human-readable and useful to an agency owner or business owner.

Avoid in user-facing tabs:

- raw job IDs
- raw client IDs
- local VPS paths
- workdirs
- scripts
- skill names
- raw cron output paths
- excessive artifact inventory

Prefer:

- client names, color-coded
- plain-English job descriptions
- readable dates
- same-window metrics
- one filter only where useful
- concise top-level summaries
- approval/status dropdowns only where they create action

## Default Tabs

- `Control Center`: what needs attention now.
- `Clients`: one row per client/site and routing details.
- `Agent Responsibilities`: plain-English list of what agents own.
- `Schedule`: recurring jobs and what they do.
- `Activity Log`: important outcomes only, not a transcript.
- `Approvals`: approval queue.
- `SEO Opportunities`: potential work from data and analysis.
- `CTR Tests`: title/meta tests from baseline to report.
- `Review Management`: local SEO review monitoring and response workflow.
- `Agent Tasks`: execution queue.
- `Telegram Routing`: operator notification routing.
- `Performance Snapshot`: same-window SEO metrics.
- `Content & Expertise`: content plan plus client SME input workflow.

## Client Workspace Layout

Create a separate workspace per client:

```text
~/seo-sites/<domain>/
  data/
  reports/
  drafts/
  logs/
  plans/
  repo/
  client-knowledge/
  site-profile.md
  approval-policy.md
  analytics-access.md
  marketing-boundaries.md
  onboarding-checklist.md
  content-writing-guidelines.md
  image-style-guide.md
  AGENTS.md
  client-config.json
```

Keep raw/internal artifacts in the workspace. Show users links only when they are reviewable or actionable.

## Telegram Onboarding Contract

When a client is added from Telegram, SEO OS must complete the visible setup loop before replying:

1. create or update the client registry/dashboard row,
2. create the per-client Hermes profile using the client name/slug,
3. create the per-client workspace and starter docs,
4. queue setup tasks and setup-needed jobs,
5. bind the Telegram topic target, and
6. send a concise confirmation back to the same Telegram topic.

The confirmation should say the dashboard was updated, which profile/workspace was created, and what the next setup step is.

## Profile Separation

Each client should have a separate Hermes profile where possible:

```bash
hermes profile create <client-slug>-seo --clone default
```

Profiles should separate memory, context, credentials, and routing.

## Daily Operating Rhythm

1. Daily refresh updates the Google Sheet from current data.
2. Schedule checks update after cron jobs run.
3. New approvals/tasks are added as work happens.
4. The Activity Log records important outcomes only.
5. Telegram receives concise summaries only when attention is needed.

Use script-only jobs for simple checks. Use cheap models for short summaries. Use stronger models for strategy and nuanced recommendations.

## Default Content Quality Rules

These defaults apply to content drafts unless a client's workspace overrides them:

- include a TL;DR near the top
- answer search intent quickly in the opening
- use content capsules for about 60 to 70 percent of the article
- add an FAQ section when the topic supports it
- include 2 to 5 contextual internal links to relevant site sections/pages
- cite high quality external sources on the specific claims they support
- link the contextual keyword or claim, not a generic "source" label
- include suggested up-links from existing pages when possible
- write in the client's voice, not the template author's
- avoid generic AI writing, hype, unsupported claims, keyword stuffing, and em dashes

See `docs/default-content-and-image-guidelines.md` for the full reusable policy.

## Content Writing and Publishing Modes

Default community mode: Google Docs draft-first.

SEO OS does not need direct CMS access to be useful. For most users, create a Google Doc draft with the recommended title, meta description, H1, content draft, internal links, and notes. The user or their web person publishes manually.

Supported modes:

- `google_doc`: default. Creates Google Docs drafts only. No CMS writes.
- `astro_cloudflare_staging`: for Git/static-site users. Creates branch/staging previews after repo and staging boundaries are verified. Production deploy remains separately gated.
- `wordpress_draft`: optional advanced mode. Only after the user deliberately connects WordPress MCP/API access. Creates drafts only, not published posts.
- `manual_only`: recommendations only. No draft or CMS writes.

Do not make WordPress or Astro automation the default for community users. Treat direct publishing as an advanced, approval-gated workflow.

## Image Style Guide Onboarding

Ask during onboarding whether the user wants Hermes to generate an image style guide for the website. This is recommended because feature images should stay visually consistent across the site.

The guide should live at:

```text
~/seo-sites/<domain>/image-style-guide.md
```

It should define aspect ratio, palette, mood, illustration/photo/abstract direction, motifs, text policy, negative prompts, examples to match, and examples to avoid. Do not copy another brand's visual style unless the user explicitly requests it.

See `templates/onboarding/image-style-guide.md`.

See `docs/content-writing-and-publishing.md` for the full policy.

## Approval Rules

Require explicit approval before:

- publishing content
- deploying changes
- redirect/canonical/noindex changes
- deleting pages
- external outreach
- sending client emails in v1
- posting negative or risky review responses

For approval dropdowns, safe v1 behavior is:

```text
status changed -> log decision -> update task -> notify operator
```

Do not make dropdowns directly execute risky production work until the workflow is proven.

## CTR Testing Workflow

1. Hermes finds high-impression / low-CTR opportunity.
2. Hermes asks operator whether to start a CTR test.
3. Approved test locks starting metrics in `CTR Tests`.
4. Hermes monitors until enough data exists.
5. Hermes creates a Google Doc report.
6. Hermes recommends the next change.

## Client Expertise Intake Workflow

Do not give clients direct Hermes or Telegram access. Use email or a simple form.

Flow:

```text
content plan -> approved topics -> SME questions -> agency approval -> client email/form -> answer processing -> knowledge library -> content briefs/drafts
```

Distill client answers into `client-knowledge/`:

- customer objections
- common questions
- stories and examples
- pricing/process nuance
- competitor differences
- claims to avoid
- voice/style notes
- reusable FAQs
- proof/assets

## Review Management Workflow

For local SEO clients, reviews can be monitored through Zernio or another GBP/review integration.

Positive reviews:

- acknowledge the review
- thank the customer
- mention service/outcome naturally if safe
- invite them to return/contact again
- can use approved templates once style is approved

Negative reviews:

- draft only
- acknowledge the experience
- thank them for feedback
- ask them to contact the owner/business directly to rectify the issue
- do not argue, blame, admit fault, or reveal private details
- require approval before posting

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] User-facing tabs avoid raw IDs and VPS paths.
- [ ] Metrics use the same date window before comparing clients.
- [ ] Risky actions are approval-gated.
- [ ] Client workspaces are separated.
- [ ] Client knowledge is distilled for reuse.
- [ ] Simple checks use scripts or cheap models.
