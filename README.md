# SEO OS AI Ranking

A reusable starter kit for running an SEO operating system with Hermes Agent and a VPS-local custom dashboard.

SEO OS gives an agency owner or business owner a structured way to run SEO work with:

- a custom SEO OS Command Center dashboard
- local SQLite operational state
- per-client Hermes profiles
- per-client VPS workspaces
- automatic dashboard updates from Discord onboarding
- Discord confirmation after client setup
- scheduled SEO checks and reports
- approval-gated agent work
- CTR tests
- review management workflows
- content and client expertise intake
- reusable client knowledge libraries

This repo is intentionally a template. It ships with fake demo data only. Do not commit client data, API tokens, private Discord IDs, Search Console exports, analytics exports, SQLite databases, logs, generated reports, or local workspace files.

## Mental model

```text
Custom SEO OS Dashboard = operating board
SQLite = local template/demo state
Hermes = worker
- Discord = operator notification layer
- Hermes profiles = client separation
VPS file system = internal workspace and data store
Google Docs / clean HTML = polished reports and client-facing deliverables
Google Sheets = optional export layer, not the primary dashboard
```

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NicoSKOOL/seo-os-ai-ranking.git
cd seo-os-ai-ranking
python3 server.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787 --reset
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

If this is running on a VPS, use an SSH tunnel or a protected reverse proxy. Do not expose the dashboard publicly without authentication.

## What v1 includes

- Command Center
- Clients / Sites
- Approvals
- Opportunities
- Agent Tasks
- Content pipeline
- Schedule
- CTR Tests
- Activity Log
- Reports
- Settings / Routing

## Template data policy

The dashboard seeds fake clients and fake metrics on first run. The seed data exists only to demonstrate the workflow and UI.

Never commit:

- `data/` SQLite databases, WAL files, raw exports, or performance snapshots
- `logs/` files
- `generated/` plans or reports
- real client workspace paths
- private Discord chat/channel IDs or thread IDs
- Search Console, GA4, Google Workspace, Cloudflare, Zernio, or email credentials
- real customer/client names unless they are intentionally public demo examples

## Client workspace setup

The setup wizard can create a local workspace skeleton for a new client:

```bash
python3 scripts/setup_seo_os.py \
  --client-name "Example Roofing" \
  --domain example.com \
  --client-type local-seo \
  --site-url https://example.com/ \
  --main-offer "Roof repair and replacement" \
  --target-audience "Homeowners in Austin" \
  --conversion-goal "Booked inspection calls" \
  --content-delivery-mode google_doc \
  --cms wordpress \
  --dry-run
```

Remove `--dry-run` only when you are ready to create local workspace files. When `--discord-channel` is present, setup also creates the per-client Hermes profile by default, upserts the local SEO OS dashboard when its SQLite DB exists, and can send a Discord confirmation message.

## Product architecture direction

SEO OS should own scheduling, approvals, work tracking, and reporting inside the custom dashboard. A Sheet can be added later as a clean export or public-friendly view, but it should not be treated as the main operating system.

Recommended member setup:

1. Connect GSC.
2. Connect GA4.
3. Connect review source, such as a GBP/review provider.
4. SEO OS creates/owns managed jobs for refreshes, opportunity scoring, and review monitoring.

Model policy:

- No model for raw API pulls and normalization.
- Cheap model for labeling, lightweight summaries, review-response drafts, and opportunity explanations.
- Stronger model only for strategic plans, SERP synthesis, and approved content/change recommendations.

## Client filtering and onboarding defaults

- Every visible tab or dashboard view must respect the active client filter. If My Inclusion is selected, CTR Tests, Schedule, Content, Approvals, Opportunities, Tasks, Activity, Reports, and Performance must show only My Inclusion rows. Global rows are allowed only in the All Clients view.
- Adding a client from Discord must create/update the client registry/dashboard row, create a per-client Hermes profile, create the workspace, queue setup tasks, and send a completion message back to the same Discord channel/thread.
- Never create a duplicate client because of slug differences. Check existing clients by exact domain and common domain variants before inserting a new row.

## Safety defaults

Dashboard approvals update state and create bounded tasks. They do not publish, deploy, redirect, noindex, canonicalize, delete pages, or send outreach. Those actions need separate explicit approval.
